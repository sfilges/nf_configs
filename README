# Nextflow config files

Custom configuration files for nextflow pipelines.

## Cloud platforms

Config files for batch analyses on infrastructure from Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

### Azure

A generic config file for Azure Batch is under `cloud/azurebatch.config`. 

A well-known issue with Azure Batch is that VM instances have fixed disk storage, 
which may lead to issues with with resource intensive workflows. In that case it may be
necessary to reudce the number of jobs created, or increase the resource requirements of 
the offending processes to reduce the number of jobs per instance. Configuration files
for specific pipelines (e.g. from nf-core) are found in their respective folders.
